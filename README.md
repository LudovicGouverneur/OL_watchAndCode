#### Intro

Breaking big project into little pieces, little tasks, is a crucial skill to become developper. That process is materialized in the _requirements_.

Having clear requirements gives us
  1. a better focus on the project
  -- It helps us work on one little piece at a time. It forbids us to get lost.
  2. it is easier to test the application in the "building" process. Is my application doing what it should do?
