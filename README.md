#### Intro

Breaking big project into little pieces, little tasks, is a crucial skill to become developper. That process is materialized in the _requirements_.

Having clear requirements gives us
  1. a better focus on the project
  -- It helps us work on one little piece at a time. It forbids us to get lost.
  2. a better way test the application in the "building" process : is my application doing what it should do?

To do List : requirements
  1. it should have a place to _store_ todos
  --*  In javascript, the _list of todos_ is represented by an _ARRAY_
  --*  __This list is _stored_ in a variable.__
  --*  We call this variable  *tudos*.
  --*  The variable *todos* is a reference to the array containing our list.
  ```javascript
  var tudos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']
  ```
  2. it should have a way to _display_ todos
  3. it should have a way to _add_ new todos
  4. it should have a way to _change_ a todo
  5. it should have a way to _delete_ a todo
